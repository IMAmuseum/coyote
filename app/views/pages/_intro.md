# What is Coyote?

Coyote is an open-source web app for creating and publishing accessible, localized descriptions of images.

The staff of the [Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago](http://mcachicago.org/) uses Coyote to allow the blind and visually impaired to engage more fully with the visual arts.  They have already described more than 1,300 images.

# Why?

Coyote allows for `alt`, `long`, `title`

You can find more information about alternate text [here](http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/) on WebAIM.

# How does it work?

When an image is uploaded to your system, an entry is created in Coyote via our API.  An administrator can tag, priortize, and assign images to other users.  After an image has been described, an administrator can approve the description and then it will go live to our API allowing it displayed on your site and apps.

# Getting started

Try uploading and describing an image here on [Coyote.pics](http://coyote.pics).

If your museum or institution is curious how an integration would work, please reach out to ...

If you are a developer, please see our [repo](https://github.com/coyote-team/coyote/) for a detailed README and our [API documentation](http://coyote.mcachicago.org/apipie). Also see the `/lib/coyote/strategies/mca.rb` for an example of a customized server integeration (beyond the standard API).

# How to write a good description

For the sighted, Coyote allows the user to focus on the challenge of accurately describing a piece of art to someone who cannot see it.
